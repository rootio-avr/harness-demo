#   harness/delegate:25.07.86408-original-final
DELEGATE_IMAGE="harness/delegate:25.07.86408-local-binaries"

# Health check retries: after startup wait, retry this many times, every HEALTH_CHECK_INTERVAL seconds (default: 6)
# Total extra wait = HEALTH_CHECK_RETRIES * HEALTH_CHECK_INTERVAL (e.g. 6 * 15 = 90s) before failing health
# STARTUP_WAIT_SECONDS="90"
